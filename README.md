# ThunderAI 

A new Flutter project :zap:.

## Getting Started

A virtual assistant application which is built on flutter and uses OpenAI API to generate automated answers and also can generate images based on user prompt

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
- [OpenAI References](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Here is the preview of the application
